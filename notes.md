# (#) Analysis of User Feedback: Initial Trends

This section provides a preliminary analysis of the feedback gathered from the questionnaire. Due to the limited dataset (10 responses), these observations highlight initial trends and should be interpreted with caution. Further data collection would be needed for more statistically significant conclusions.

## (##) Technical Interest and Background

* **Technical Inclination:** A majority of respondents (6 out of 10) indicated they have a strong interest in technology. This suggests a good mix of perspectives, with both technically-minded and non-technical users providing feedback.
* **Course of Study (Technical Participants):** Among those with a technical interest, the reported courses varied, including GCSE Computer Science, Computer Science, Software Development (T-Level and general), and MA Education with Technology. This diversity in technical backgrounds could provide varied insights into the system's technical aspects.

## (##) Perceived Robustness and Code Understandability (Technical Participants)

* **Robustness:** The technical participants generally rated the apparent robustness (stability and error handling) of the system shown in screenshots moderately high, with scores ranging from 4 to 5 (on a scale of 1 to 6). This suggests an initial positive impression of the system's underlying stability.
* **Code Understandability:** Opinions on the ease of understanding the codebase (based on screenshots) were more varied among technical participants, with scores ranging from 1 to 6. This could indicate differences in code clarity, commenting, or the participants' individual experience levels. One participant expressed low confidence (score of 1) in their ability to contribute, which warrants further investigation.

## (##) Account Functionality

* **Ease of Use:** Across all respondents, the core account functionalities (registering, logging in, changing name, logging out, and finding the delete option) were generally rated as easy to use, with most scores falling between 5 and 6 (on a scale of 1 to 6). This suggests a user-friendly design for basic account management. However, there were a few lower ratings (3 and 4) for finding the delete option, indicating a potential area for improved discoverability.

## (##) Booking and Calculator Functionality

* **Booking System:** The ease of creating, deleting, and finding information about bookings was also generally rated positively (mostly 5 and 6). This suggests the booking system is perceived as relatively intuitive.
* **Calculator:** The feedback on the calculator functionality was more mixed. While the ease of understanding and using the inputs received moderate ratings (mostly 5), the perceived relevance of the calculator's purpose and questions varied more significantly (ranging from 3 to 6). This suggests a potential need to re-evaluate the calculator's utility or the clarity of its purpose.

## (##) Home Page Experience

* **Content Quality:** The perceived quality of the articles or content on the home page received somewhat lower ratings (ranging from 2 to 6), indicating a potential area for improvement in content relevance or presentation.
* **Navigation and Layout:** The ease of navigation and the overall layout and organization of the home page were rated more positively (mostly 5 and 6), suggesting a generally well-structured home page in terms of usability.

## (##) Navigation and Footer

* **Locating Elements:** Finding the main navigation bar, specific links within it, and the website's footer was consistently rated as easy (mostly 5 and 6). This indicates good placement and visibility of these key navigational elements.
* **Contact Information:** Locating the contact address and email within the footer also received high ease-of-finding ratings, suggesting this information is readily accessible.

## (##) Visual Design and User Interface

* **Colour Scheme Preference:** The "Dark mode" was the overwhelmingly preferred colour scheme among the respondents who specified their preference.
* **Visual Appeal:** Ratings for the visual pleasingness of the colours used on the site were moderate (ranging from 1 to 6), with a few lower scores. This suggests the colour scheme might not be universally appealing and could benefit from further consideration.
* **Ease of Interaction:** The ease of using various elements (buttons, links, text areas) generally received positive ratings (mostly 5 and 6), indicating good usability of individual UI components.

## (##) Perceived Good and Poor Design

* **Good Design:** The "Home" page was frequently selected as having good design. Other sections like "Calculator" and "Booking" also received multiple positive mentions.
* **Poor Design:** "Home" and "Calculator" were also mentioned as having poor design by some respondents, highlighting potentially conflicting opinions or specific elements within these sections that need attention. "Account," "T&Cs," and "Cookies" were also identified as areas of poor design by at least one respondent.

## (##) Questionnaire Clarity

* The clarity and ease of understanding the questionnaire were generally rated positively (mostly 4 to 6), suggesting the feedback instrument itself was reasonably well-designed. However, a few lower ratings (1) indicate that some respondents found it difficult to understand.

## (##) Other Comments and Suggestions

* One respondent suggested improving the website layout, allowing the navigation bar to stay out of the way, making the navigation bar text link to the home page, and improving colour and design options. This provides specific actionable feedback. Another respondent simply stated "very swag," which, while positive, lacks specific details.

**Further Steps:**

This initial analysis provides a starting point. To gain a deeper understanding of these results, the following steps are recommended:

* **Increase Sample Size:** Gather more responses to ensure the trends observed are statistically significant and representative of the target user base.
* **Cross-Tabulation:** Analyze the data by segmenting responses based on technical interest to see if there are significant differences in how technical and non-technical users perceive different aspects of the website.
* **Qualitative Analysis:** Review the open-ended comments in more detail to identify recurring themes and specific pain points.
* **Follow-up:** Consider follow-up questions or brief interviews with respondents who provided particularly low or high ratings, or detailed suggestions, to gain a deeper understanding of their reasoning.
