# How To Aid Future Development
## Gathering Feedback
One should gather information on something is the best way to improve its quality. Gathering user feedback on a website is best medium to higher the standards. When taking feedback, it is important to gather critical information to the question at hand. 
## How to gather feedback
The best way to gather feedback is to ask the user on a one-to-one basis; while this does work it becomes difficult to make charts of numbers. A more efficient way to give each user a questionnaire to fill out; this less of a human approach and things can go wrong with the site. The best of both would be to have a user fill out a form while being supervised: to ensure that the user gets a good experience of the site, and the form gets good data. To also have a backup of a power point of what the site is like, should features on the site stop workings, to show the user. To get a higher number of users to give feedback the best thing to do is to offer an incentive to them.
# Making The Form
## The Design
When designing a questionnaire, a crucial initial step involves identifying the target demographic. In this instance, the participants can be broadly categorised into those with technical expertise and those without.
## Technical Participants
These individuals possess a demonstrable level of competence in computer systems and software development. Their experience may range from a foundational understanding to advanced proficiency in software engineering principles and practices.
## Non-Technical Participants
This group, conversely, lacks formal training or significant practical experience in software development or computer systems.
Accurately classifying participants is paramount for tailoring the questionnaire's language and complexity, ensuring its accessibility and relevance. While a direct "yes/no" question could offer a rudimentary classification, a more nuanced approach is preferable. This could involve a preliminary assessment of participants' educational background, professional experience, or self-reported technical skills. For example, participants could be asked to rate their proficiency in specific software or programming languages, or to describe their experience with software development methodologies.
## How To Write a Good Questionnaire
Crafting an effective questionnaire necessitates meticulous attention to detail and adherence to established best practices. The following principles are crucial.
### Relevance
Each question must directly contribute to the research objectives, avoiding extraneous or tangential inquiries, e.g. "do you like butter on your toast?".
### Conciseness
Questions should be brief and to the point, minimising cognitive load and maximising participant engagement.
### Clarity
Employing straightforward, unambiguous language is essential. Avoid jargon, technical terms, or overly complex sentence structures that may confuse respondents.
### Logical Sequencing
Questions should be arranged in a logical order, progressing from general to specific, and grouping related items thematically.
### Sensitivity
Handle sensitive or confidential data (e.g., personal information) with the utmost care, adhering to ethical guidelines and data protection regulations.
Neutrality: Questions should be phrased in a neutral, unbiased manner, avoiding leading questions or those that may influence responses.
### Pilot Testing
Before widespread distribution, the questionnaire should be rigorously tested with a representative sample to identify any potential ambiguities, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement.
## Question Types
### Closed Questions
These offer pre-defined response options, facilitating quantitative analysis and minimising response variability.
### Open Questions
While valuable for gathering rich, qualitative data, these require more time and effort from participants and are more challenging to analyse systematically. Their use should be judicious and purposeful. It is important to note that closed questions, whilst easier to analyse, can sometimes force respondents into categories that don't truly reflect their views. Therefore, a balance of both is often advocated.
### Response Scales
When using scales (e.g. Likert scales), avoid a neutral midpoint (e.g. "neither agree nor disagree") to encourage respondents to express a definite opinion.
Where to write the questionnaire, several platforms are available for creating and hosting online questionnaires. While platforms like Microsoft Forms offer branching logic and integration with other Microsoft products, my proficiency lies in leveraging Google Forms. This platform provides a user-friendly interface, robust data analysis capabilities, and seamless accessibility for participants. The selection of a platform should be driven by factors such as the researcher's familiarity, the platform's features branching logic, data export options, and its compliance with data protection regulations.
## What Questions to Include
The questionnaire should elicit information relevant to the research objectives. At a minimum, it should include the following.
### Participant Identification
An email address and name are necessary for tracking responses and, if applicable, for follow-up communication. However, it's vital to consider data protection and anonymity requirements.
### Technical Background
Questions regarding the participant's current employment or education are essential for categorising them as technical or non-technical. This section could be expanded to include specific questions about their experience with relevant technologies, programming languages, or software development methodologies.
### Website Evaluation
Questions should assess the quality, usability, robustness, and aesthetic appeal (styles and colours) of the website under evaluation. These questions should be carefully crafted to elicit specific, actionable feedback.
Form Evaluation: An overview of the form itself is needed to gauge the accuracy and reliability of the collected data. This could include questions about the clarity of instructions, the ease of navigation, and the perceived length and complexity of the questionnaire.
# The Questionnaire
## The Sections
The form has been split up into 9 bite-sized sections, this is to keep the user engaged with each section; each section covers a different part of the website with a few questions to answer; in each section covers the minimum number of questions for the user to answer. 
### Section 1

1. What is your name
    - this question aims to simply ask the user their name for later identification
2. Would you describe yourself as a technically minded person
    - this question aims to ask the user if they can be asked the more technical questions in the form
    - either answering “yes” or “no”

### Section 2

1. What is the title of the course you are studying
    - short text
    - this is to gauge a feel for how level the user is with technical experience
2. Looking at the screen shots, how do you feel robustness was handled
    - a range of 1 to 6, of poor to good
    - this aims to ask if they think error handling practices where to an acceptable level
3. How easily can you understand the code base
    - a range of 1 to 6, of unintelligible to easy
    - this aims to ask if the layout and formatting of the code works a treat or not
