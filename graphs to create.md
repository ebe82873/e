## List of Graphs to Create for Feedback Analysis

Here's a breakdown of potential graphs to visualize the feedback data:

**1. Demographics & Background:**

* **Technical Interest:**
    ```markdown
    ### Pie Chart: Technical Interest
    ```
    *(Shows the proportion of respondents with and without a strong interest in technology.)*

* **Course of Study (Technical Participants):**
    ```markdown
    ### Bar Chart: Courses of Study (Technical Participants)
    ```
    *(Displays the different courses mentioned by technically-minded participants.)*

**2. Likert Scale Responses:**

* **Stacked Bar Charts (Example: Account Functionality):**
    ```markdown
    ### Stacked Bar Chart: Ease of Account Functionality
    ```
    *(Shows the distribution of responses (1-6) for: Ease of Registration, Login, Changing Name, Logout, Finding Delete Option.)*

* **Average Score with Error Bars (Example: Perceived Robustness):**
    ```markdown
    ### Bar Chart with Error Bars: Perceived Robustness
    ```
    *(Displays the average rating and variability for the perceived robustness of the system.)*

    * **Consider creating similar stacked bar charts or average score charts for:**
        * Ease of Booking System Features
        * Ease and Relevance of Calculator Features
        * Home Page Content Quality, Navigation Ease, Layout Organisation
        * Ease of Locating Navigation and Footer Elements
        * Visual Appeal and Ease of UI Element Interaction
        * Questionnaire Clarity

**3. Multiple Choice Responses (Design Perceptions):**

* **Bar Chart: Pages/Sections with Good Design:**
    ```markdown
    ### Bar Chart: Pages/Sections with Good Design
    ```
    *(Shows the frequency of selection for each page/section identified as having good design.)*

* **Bar Chart: Pages/Sections with Poor Design:**
    ```markdown
    ### Bar Chart: Pages/Sections with Poor Design
    ```
    *(Shows the frequency of selection for each page/section identified as having poor design.)*

* **Bar Chart: Pages/Sections Needing Improved Design:**
    ```markdown
    ### Bar Chart: Pages/Sections Needing Improved Design
    ```
    *(Shows the frequency of selection for each page/section suggested for design improvement.)*

**4. Colour Scheme Preference:**

* **Preferred Colour Scheme:**
    ```markdown
    ### Pie Chart: Preferred Colour Scheme
    ```
    *(Shows the proportion of respondents who preferred Light mode vs. Dark mode.)*

**Key Considerations for Graph Creation:**

* **Clear Titles:** Use descriptive titles for each graph.
* **Labeled Axes:** Label all axes appropriately.
* **Legends:** Include legends for different colours or categories.
* **Simplicity:** Keep graphs easy to understand.
* **Relevance to Analysis:** Ensure graphs directly support your written analysis.
